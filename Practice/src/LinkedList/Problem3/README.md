## Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list of integers, determine the middle node of the linked list. 
However, if the linked list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node.

### Example 1:
Input: LL: 1  2  3  4  5

Output: 3

Explanation: Node with value 3 is the middle node of this linked list.


### Example 2:
Input: LL: 1  2  3  4  5  6

Output: 4

Explanation:  In this example, the linked list has an even number of nodes hence we return the second middle node which is 4.
